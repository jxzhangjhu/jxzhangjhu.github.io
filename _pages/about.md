<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a Research Scientist at [Salesforce AI Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/), specializing in Reliable AI Agents and Foundation Model.

**Previously**: I was a Senior Staff Research Scientist and founding member, building AI Research Team at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/). Prior to this, I was a Staff Research Scientist in Computer Science and Mathematics Division at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/). I received my Ph.D. from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).

 <!-- My interest span multiple areas, including reliabile and robust AI, generative models (LLMs and diffusion models), uncertainty quantification, and AI for Science. -->

<!-- **Previously:** I was a Research Staff in Computer Science and Mathematics Dvision at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/), [US Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/). I received my Ph.D. from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2018.  -->

<!-- **Publications and Service**:  -->

<!-- **Publications:** 50+ peer-review journal/conference papers, and 35+ first-author papers, including several top-tier AI conferences, e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, etc, and high-impact journals, such as Nature series.

**Service:** Invited Reviewer or PC member in NeurIPS 2020-2023, ICML 2021-2023, ICLR 2021-2024, AISTATS 2021-2023, CVPR 2022, ECCV 2022, KDD 2023, ICASSP 2024, SIAM SDM 2024, WACV 2024, etc.  -->


💬 I'm always looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to work with me for research internship positions. Please feel free to email me with your CV if interested.

 I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/">generalization</a>, and <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/HACO/">safety</a>. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>. 

See <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/">MetaDriverse</a> for recent work on machine autonomy and <a href="https://genforce.github.io/">GenForce</a> for recent work on generative modeling. -->
