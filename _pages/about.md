Hi, there! I'm **Jiaxin**ðŸ‘‹!. 

<!-- I am an AI Researcher at [Intuit AI Research](https://www.intuit.com/technology/), leading a research team working in Reliable and Robust AI.  -->

ðŸ”­ I am a Senior Staff Research Scientist at [Intuit AI Research](https://www.intuit.com/technology/), leading a research team working in **Generative AI** (large language models, diffusion models, vision-language models), and **AI Reliability** (uncertainty, confidence, and robustness). Prior to this, I was a Research Staff in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/), US Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/)), where my research aims at accelerating *AI for Science* on supercomputers, such as [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/) and [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/). I received my Ph.D. from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) with an emphasis on [uncertainty quantification](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/items/e16083fd-45c4-4ec1-936a-dff3e08e1382). 


<!-- **Recent Research Interest:**   -->

ðŸ¤” I am passionate about building reliable AI capability to assist humans in solving complex real-world problems at the intersection of language, vision, and science. My research interests mainly focus on AI **Reliability** and **Robustness**, **Uncertainty Quantification**, **LLM Alignement** and **Safety**, **Optimization**, and **AI4Science**. I have published over 50 (35+ first authors) top-tier AI conference and jounral papers, e.g., *NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, AISTATS*, etc, and served as PC member of *ICML, ICLR*, and Area Chair of *ACL, EMNLP and NAACL*. 

âš¡ Some research highlights include: 
- [Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01740) and [Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02132)
- [Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02509) in LLMs
- [Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11347) w/wo [Security and Safety Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09652)
- [Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09629) and [Reliable RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08320)
- [LLM Adaption and Fine-tuning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/f6c1843f11d34312b11ec5ff9a10c5a6-Abstract-Conference.html) 
- [Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03604) and [Holistic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14643)  
- Constrained Generation and Inferece-time Decoding (ongoing)
- LLM Alignment with Feedback (ongoing)

 I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/">generalization</a>, and <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/HACO/">safety</a>. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>. 

See <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/">MetaDriverse</a> for recent work on machine autonomy and <a href="https://genforce.github.io/">GenForce</a> for recent work on generative modeling. -->
