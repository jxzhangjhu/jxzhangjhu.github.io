<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

**Research:** As an AI researcher, I am passionate about building AGI capability and assisting humans in solving complex real-world tasks ranging from Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My interest span multiple areas, including reliabile and robust AI, generative models (LLMs and diffusion models), uncertainty quantification, and AI for Science.

**Previously:** I was a Research Staff in Computer Science and Mathematics Dvision at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/), [US Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/). I received my Ph.D. from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2018. 

<!-- **Publications and Service**:  -->

**Publications:** 50+ peer-review journal/conference papers, and 35+ first-author papers, including several top-tier AI conferences, e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, etc, and high-impact journals, such as Nature series.

**Service:** Invited Reviewer or PC member in NeurIPS 2020-2023, ICML 2021-2023, ICLR 2021-2024, AISTATS 2021-2023, CVPR 2022, ECCV 2022, KDD 2023, ICASSP 2024, SIAM SDM 2024, WACV 2024, etc. 


<span style="color:orange">I'm always looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to work with me for research internship positions. Please feel free to email me with your CV if interested.

 I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/">generalization</a>, and <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/HACO/">safety</a>. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>. 

See <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/">MetaDriverse</a> for recent work on machine autonomy and <a href="https://genforce.github.io/">GenForce</a> for recent work on generative modeling. -->
