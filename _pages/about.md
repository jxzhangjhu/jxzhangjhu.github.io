<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

**Research:** As an AI researcher, I am focused on developing reliable and robust methods for modeling, analyzing and generting complex data ranging from vision and language. My interest span multiple areas, including reliabile and robust AI, generative AI, uncertainty quantification, and AI for Science. 

**Previously:** I was a Research Staff in Computer Science and Mathematics Dvision at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/), [US Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/). I received my Ph.D. from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). 

<!-- 
 I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/">generalization</a>, and <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/HACO/">safety</a>. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>. 

See <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/">MetaDriverse</a> for recent work on machine autonomy and <a href="https://genforce.github.io/">GenForce</a> for recent work on generative modeling. -->
