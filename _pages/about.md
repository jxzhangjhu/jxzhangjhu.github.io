Hi, there! I'm **Jiaxin**👋!. 

<!-- I am an AI Researcher at [Intuit AI Research](https://www.intuit.com/technology/), leading a research team working in Reliable and Robust AI.  -->

🔭 I am an AI Senior Staff Research Scientist at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/research/), leading a research team specializing in **Generative AI** (including large language models, diffusion models, vision-language models), and **AI Reliability** (focusing on uncertainty, confidence, and robustness). Prior to this, I was a Research Staff in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) (ORNL) under the US Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/)). My research at ORNL was dedicated to advancing *AI for Science* on state-of-the-art supercomputers, like [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/) and [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/). I received my Ph.D. from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) with an emphasis on [uncertainty quantification](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/items/e16083fd-45c4-4ec1-936a-dff3e08e1382). 


<!-- **Recent Research Interest:**   -->

🤔 I am passionate about building reliable AI capability to assist humans in solving complex real-world challenges found at the convergence of language, vision, and science. My research concentrates on AI **Reliability** and **Robustness**, **Uncertainty Quantification**, **LLM Alignement** and **Safety**, **Optimization**, and **AI4Science**. I have authored over 50 papers, including 35+ as the first author, in leading AI conferences and journals such as *NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, AISTATS*, and others. Additionally, I actively maintain several [GitHub](https://github.com/jxzhangjhu) repositories that have collectively garnered over 2,000 stars.
